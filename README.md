AI Chatbot for IT Recruitment
•	Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced quickly in recent years, especially in my field of recruiting, where businesses aim to streamline hiring procedures.
•	The volume, pace, and quality of candidate engagement provide challenges for talent acquisition teams in the highly competitive world of IT recruitment.  Conventional manual hiring practices frequently lead to minimal client engagement with applicant shortlisting and interview scheduling, which impacts our clients' performance scorecard.
•	As a result, AI-powered chatbots have become a noteworthy innovation, automating screening, initial candidate encounters, and round-the-clock query response.  Businesses like HireVue, Paradox Olivia, and IBM (Watson Assistant) have shown how conversational AI can revolutionize hiring processes.
•	The goal of this project is to examine and assess how AI-powered chatbots might improve applicant satisfaction and process efficiency in IT recruitment, as well as the recruiter's workflow by facilitating it simpler for them to provide high-quality work to clientele.
